# cjdns for Ubiquiti EdgeOS / Vyatta

### Introduction

This is a cjdns distributable package for Ubiquiti EdgeOS or Vyatta-based platforms such as VyOS. It supports configuration through the standard Vyatta configuration editor and should therefore be very straight-forward to deploy.

At this time this package is in very early stages of development, but the ultimate aim is to provide binary builds for some commonly-used platforms with pre-built cjdns binaries.

### Building

This is a bare-bones Debian package. Build instructions still to come.
